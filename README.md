## About Me 💁🏻‍♀️<a name="about-me"></a>
Hey there! My name is Ayeshna Singh ,am an ambitious full stack developer from India. I started coding when I was 14 years old, and it's crazy how I continued on with my learning journey, first with JAVA, then C++, and finally C. In an ideal world, it would have been the other way about, but I believe if you are building skills ,the path that you choose doesn't really matter.
I am persuing the bachelors degree in the electronics and telecommunication field at [Thakur College of Engineering and Tecnology](https://www.tcetmumbai.in/)
I also enjoy singing!
